## Java Fundamentals Course

A collection of Java notes, exercises, small projects, and rest from the Java course I took on Udemy. The course is called [The Complete Java Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-java-development-bootcamp/) and it's created by Rayan Slim, Jad Slim, and Jose Portilla.

For more info about a specific topic, navigate to that topic's directory and check out the readme file for the notes.
