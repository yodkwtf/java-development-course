## Functions

A **Function** is a group of code that performs a particular task. Functions make your code more organized and reusable.

There are 5 components for every function -

1. Level of access
2. Return value
3. Function name
4. Parameters
5. Code inside functions

```java
// 1     2    3      4
public void name (int param) {
  // code -> 5
}
```

- Function can be called as many times as needed using syntax `functionName()`
- Function names should be _lowerCamelCase_
- Functions are also called methods at times
