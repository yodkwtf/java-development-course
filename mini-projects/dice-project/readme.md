## Dice Jack Game

Built for the Functions section. Uses function calls, built-in functions, return statements, parameters, and boolean conditionals.

#### Working

- User picks 3 numbers b/w 1-6 (let's say 4, 3, 4)
- Add the 3 numbers (11)
- Roll the dice 3 times (let's say we get 6, 2, 1)
- Calculate the sum (9)
- User wins if:
  - Sum of dice rolls **less than** sum of chose numbers (true)
  - **AND** the difference b/w the 2 numbers is less than 3 (true)
- Hence, user wins in this case.
